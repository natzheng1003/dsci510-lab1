When we try to invoke lab1.py, we will first need to click  green button "Code" and copy the website url (https://github.com/natzheng1003/dsci510-lab1). The next step is to open terminal, write down the command "git clone" and paste the repository url. This command copies the repository from Github to our computers. The last step is use python to run the lab1.py file in terminal, which is to write down the code "python lab1.py". Before we run the lab1.py, we have to make sure we downloaded the software, "Git". These are some steps to invoke lab1.py.
